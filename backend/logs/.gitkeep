# Logs directory

This directory contains application logs generated by Winston logger.

## Log Files

- `error.log` - Contains only error-level logs
- `combined.log` - Contains all log levels (info, warn, error, etc.)

## Log Rotation

Logs are automatically rotated when they reach 5MB in size, with up to 5 backup files kept.

## Development vs Production

- **Development**: Logs are also output to console with colorized formatting
- **Production**: Logs are written only to files for better performance

## Log Levels

- `error` - Error conditions
- `warn` - Warning conditions
- `info` - Informational messages
- `debug` - Debug-level messages

You can control the log level using the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
