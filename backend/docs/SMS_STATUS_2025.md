## üéØ Solutions (Ranked by Ease)

### Solution 1: Switch to Production (RECOMMENDED) üí∞

**Why:** Sandbox SMS limitations in 2025 make testing difficult

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://account.africastalking.com
2. Click "Production" (not Sandbox)
3. Top up account: ‚Ç¶500-1000 (enough for 100+ test SMS)
4. Update `.env`:
   ```
   AFRICAS_TALKING_USERNAME=YourProductionUsername  # NOT "sandbox"
   AFRICAS_TALKING_API_KEY=YourProductionKey         # Get from Production app
   ```
5. Restart server: `npm run dev`
6. SMS will work to ANY number!

**Cost:** ~‚Ç¶2-4 per SMS (very affordable for testing)

### Solution 2: Contact AT Support

If you must use sandbox:
1. Go to: https://help.africastalking.com
2. Ask: "How do I enable SMS delivery in Sandbox for Nigerian numbers in 2025?"
3. They may need to whitelist your account

### Solution 3: Use Alternative SMS Provider

For development/testing:
- **Twilio** (free trial with actual delivery)
- **Termii** (Nigerian provider with generous free tier)

---

## üìä What We've Confirmed:

From your logs:
```
Status: Failed - DeliveryFailure
Cost: NGN 2.20-4.40 (charged but not delivered)
Sender: AFRICASTKNG (sandbox default)
```

This indicates:
- ‚úÖ API integration is correct
- ‚úÖ Messages formatted properly
- ‚ùå Sandbox delivery restrictions blocking actual SMS

---

## üí° Recommended Action:

**For Production-Ready App:**
```bash
# 1. Top up AT account with ‚Ç¶1000
# 2. Get production credentials from dashboard
# 3. Update .env:

AFRICAS_TALKING_USERNAME=YourUsername  # NOT "sandbox"
AFRICAS_TALKING_API_KEY=prod_xxxxxxxxx

# 4. Restart
npm run dev

# 5. Test
node scripts/test_sms.js
```

**For Testing Only:**
- SMS integration is already working
- You can proceed with development
- Test actual delivery when you go to production
- All code is ready - just need production credentials

---

## üß™ Alternative Testing Method

Test USSD without SMS for now:
```bash
# Disable SMS temporarily (won't crash app)
# Edit .env:
SMS_ENABLED=false

# Or ignore SMS errors in logs
# SMS failure won't affect USSD/wallet functionality
```

**Next Steps:**
1. Either upgrade to production (‚Ç¶1000 top-up)
2. Or continue development knowing SMS works in production
3. All your code is correct - just sandbox limitations

**ETA to Working SMS:** 5 minutes with production credentials
