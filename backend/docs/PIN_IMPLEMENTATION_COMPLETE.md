# ✅ PIN Security Implementation - Complete!

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### **4-Digit PIN Security for Withdrawals**

Your KudiPay USSD withdrawal system now requires users to enter a 4-digit numeric PIN before any withdrawal can be processed. This includes:

- ✅ **Bank withdrawals**
- ✅ **Mobile money withdrawals**
- ✅ **Cash agent pickups**

---

## 🔐 Key Features

### 1. **PIN Format Validation**

- Must be exactly **4 digits** (0000-9999)
- No letters, special characters, or spaces allowed
- Validated before checking against database

### 2. **Attempt Limiting**

- **3 chances** to enter correct PIN
- After each failed attempt, user sees remaining attempts
- Clear feedback: "Invalid PIN. 2 attempt(s) remaining."

### 3. **Automatic Account Locking**

- After **3 consecutive failed attempts**, account locks for **30 minutes**
- During lockout, ALL withdrawal attempts are blocked
- User sees: "Account locked. Try again in X minute(s)."

### 4. **Auto-Reset on Success**

- When user enters correct PIN, failed attempts reset to 0
- Account unlocks automatically
- Clean slate for next transaction

### 5. **Time-Based Auto-Unlock**

- After 30 minutes, lock expires automatically
- User can try again with full 3 attempts

## 📱 User Experience

### **Successful Withdrawal Flow**

```
*123# → 3 (Withdraw) → 5000 (Amount) → 1 (Bank)
→ 0123456789 (Account) → 2 (GTBank) → 1234 (PIN)
✅ "Withdrawal of ₦5,000 to GTBank initiated. Ref: TXN_123"
```

### **Failed PIN (1st Attempt)**

```
... → 9999 (Wrong PIN)
❌ "Invalid PIN. 2 attempt(s) remaining."
```

### **Failed PIN (2nd Attempt)**

```
... → 8888 (Wrong PIN)
❌ "Invalid PIN. 1 attempt(s) remaining."
```

### **Account Locked (3rd Attempt)**

```
... → 7777 (Wrong PIN)
🔒 "Too many failed attempts. Account locked for 30 minutes."
```

### **Locked Account Try**

```
... → 1234 (Even correct PIN)
🔒 "Account locked. Try again in 28 minute(s)."
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### **Quick Test:**

1. Register a user with PIN: 1234
2. Try to withdraw money
3. Enter wrong PIN 3 times
4. Verify account is locked
5. Wait or manually unlock
6. Try with correct PIN

### **Detailed Testing:**

See `backend/docs/PIN_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for 6 comprehensive test scenarios with SQL queries.

## 🚀 What's Next?

### **Before Production:**

1. ✅ **Run the migration** (add database columns)
2. ✅ **Test all 6 scenarios** (see testing guide)
3. ✅ **Test on Africa's Talking sandbox**
4. 🔄 **Add PIN hashing** (use bcrypt for production)
5. 🔄 **Add SMS notifications** (alert on lockout)
6. 🔄 **Implement PIN reset flow** (for forgotten PINs)

### **Optional Enhancements:**

- Block weak PINs (0000, 1111, 1234)
- Progressive lockout (longer for repeat offenses)
- Admin panel to view/unlock accounts
- Audit logging for compliance
- Biometric authentication (future mobile app)

---

## 💡 Usage Examples

### **In USSD Service:**

```javascript
// User enters PIN
const user = await User.findByPhone(phoneNumber);

// Verify with automatic limiting
const result = await user.verifyPinWithLimiting(inputPin);

if (!result.success) {
  return `END ${result.message}`; // Shows error + attempts left
}

// PIN correct - process withdrawal
await processWithdrawal(...);
```

### **Check Lock Status:**

```javascript
const user = await User.findByPhone(phoneNumber);

if (user.isLocked()) {
  const minutes = user.getRemainingLockTime();
  return `END Account locked. Try again in ${minutes} minutes.`;
}
```

### **Manual Unlock (Admin):**

```sql
UPDATE users
SET pin_failed_attempts = 0,
    pin_locked_until = NULL
WHERE phone_number = '+2348012345678';
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### **Why 4 Digits?**

- Easy to remember
- Quick to enter on USSD
- Industry standard for mobile money
- 10,000 possible combinations (0000-9999)

### **Why 3 Attempts?**

- Balance between security and usability
- Prevents brute force attacks (would take 3,333 tries to guess all PINs)
- Gives genuine users chance to correct typos
- Standard in banking systems

### **Why 30 Minutes?**

- Long enough to deter attackers
- Short enough not to frustrate legitimate users
- Time to contact support if needed
- Can be adjusted based on security requirements

## 🎉 Summary

**PIN security for withdrawals is now fully implemented!**

Every withdrawal requires a 4-digit PIN, with automatic account locking after 3 failed attempts. Users get clear feedback at every step, and the system protects against unauthorized access while remaining user-friendly.

**Next step**: Run the migration and start testing!

```bash
# 1. Apply database changes
psql -U your_username -d kudipay_db -f backend/migrations/add_pin_security.sql

# 2. Restart backend
cd backend
npm start

# 3. Test via USSD
# Dial: *123# and try withdrawing
```
