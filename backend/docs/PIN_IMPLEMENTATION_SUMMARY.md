- ✅ No special characters or letters allowed

### Attempt Limiting

- ✅ Maximum 3 consecutive failed attempts
- ✅ 30-minute lockout after 3rd failure
- ✅ Real-time feedback on remaining attempts
- ✅ Auto-reset on successful verification

### Account Locking

- ✅ Automatic lock after 3 failures

## 🔄 Withdrawal Flow with PIN

```
1. User: Select "Withdraw Money"
2. System: "Enter amount to withdraw (NGN):"
3. User: Enters amount (e.g., 5000)
4. System: "Select withdrawal method: 1. Bank 2. Mobile Money 3. Cash Agent"
5. User: Selects method (e.g., 1 for Bank)
6. System: "Enter your bank account number:"
7. User: Enters account (e.g., 0123456789)
8. System: "Select your bank: 1. Access 2. GTBank 3. First Bank..."
9. User: Selects bank (e.g., 2 for GTBank)
10. System: "Withdraw ₦5,000 to GTBank? Account: 0123456789
             Enter your 4-digit PIN to confirm:"
11. User: Enters PIN (e.g., 1234)
12. System: Verifies PIN
    ├─ ✅ Valid: "END Withdrawal initiated. Ref: TXN_123"
    └─ ❌ Invalid: "END Invalid PIN. X attempt(s) remaining."
```

## 📊 Database Schema

```sql
-- Users table with PIN security
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    phone_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    wallet_address VARCHAR(42) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    private_key VARCHAR(66) NOT NULL,
    pin VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
    pin_failed_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0,        -- NEW
    pin_locked_until TIMESTAMP,                   -- NEW
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_pin_locked ON users(pin_locked_until)
WHERE pin_locked_until IS NOT NULL;
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Migration

```bash
cd /home/vahalla/Desktop/kudipay_backend/backend
psql -U your_username -d kudipay_db -f migrations/add_pin_security.sql
```

### Verify Implementation

```sql
-- Check if columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'users'
AND column_name IN ('pin_failed_attempts', 'pin_locked_until');
```

### Test Scenarios

See `docs/PIN_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for 6 comprehensive test scenarios

## 📈 User Experience

### Success Messages

```
✅ "PIN verified successfully."
✅ "Withdrawal of ₦5,000 to GTBank (0123456789) initiated successfully. Ref: TXN_123"
```

### Error Messages

```
❌ "PIN must be exactly 4 digits."
❌ "Invalid PIN. 2 attempt(s) remaining."
❌ "Invalid PIN. 1 attempt(s) remaining."
❌ "Too many failed attempts. Account locked for 30 minutes."
❌ "Account locked. Try again in 28 minute(s)."
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Production-Ready Improvements

1. **PIN Hashing** (Critical)

   ```javascript
   const bcrypt = require("bcrypt");
   const pinHash = await bcrypt.hash(pin, 10);
   ```

2. **Weak PIN Prevention**

   - Block: 0000, 1111, 1234, 4321, etc.

3. **SMS Notifications**

   - Alert on 3rd failed attempt
   - Notify on account lock
   - Confirm successful withdrawals

4. **Progressive Lockout**

   - 3 attempts → 30 minutes
   - 6 attempts → 2 hours
   - 9 attempts → 24 hours

5. **Admin Panel**

   - View locked accounts
   - Manual unlock capability
   - Audit logs

6. **PIN Reset Flow**
   - OTP verification
   - Security questions
   - Customer support override

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Logging

### Key Metrics to Track

- Failed PIN attempts per user
- Number of locked accounts
- Average lockout duration
- Withdrawal success rate
- PIN reset requests

### Logging

All PIN-related events are logged:

```javascript
logger.info("PIN verification attempt", {
  phoneNumber: user.phoneNumber,
  success: result.success,
  attemptsRemaining: result.attemptsRemaining,
});
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Current Implementation

✅ Rate limiting (3 attempts)
✅ Time-based lockout (30 minutes)
✅ Format validation (4 digits only)
✅ Real-time user feedback
✅ Audit trail in database

### Recommended for Production

🔄 PIN hashing with bcrypt
🔄 Encryption at rest
🔄 HTTPS/TLS for transmission
🔄 Session token validation
🔄 IP-based rate limiting
🔄 Biometric fallback (future)

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: User forgot PIN
**Solution**: Implement PIN reset via OTP (future)

**Issue**: Account locked unfairly
**Solution**: Admin can manually unlock via SQL:

```sql
UPDATE users
SET pin_failed_attempts = 0, pin_locked_until = NULL
WHERE phone_number = '+2348012345678';
```

**Issue**: PIN not working
**Debug**:

```sql
SELECT phone_number, pin, pin_failed_attempts,
       pin_locked_until, pin_locked_until > NOW() as is_locked
FROM users WHERE phone_number = '+2348012345678';
```
