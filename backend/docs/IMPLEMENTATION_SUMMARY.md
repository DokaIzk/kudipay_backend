# KudiPay Flutterwave Integration - Complete Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive integration of **Flutterwave payment gateway** with the **KudiPay USSD-blockchain remittance system** for Nigeria and Kenya. The integration enables users to withdraw crypto remittances to local bank accounts and mobile money wallets.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Flutterwave Service** (`src/services/flutterwaveService.js`)
Core service handling all Flutterwave API interactions:

- ✅ **Nigerian Bank Transfers** - Withdraw to any Nigerian bank account
- ✅ **Kenyan Bank Transfers** - Withdraw to Kenyan bank accounts
- ✅ **Mobile Money Transfers** - MTN, Airtel, M-Pesa, Glo, 9Mobile
- ✅ **Account Verification** - Verify bank accounts before withdrawal
- ✅ **Transfer Status Tracking** - Check transfer status in real-time
- ✅ **Webhook Processing** - Handle Flutterwave callback events
- ✅ **Transaction Recording** - Save all transfers to database

**Features:**
- Mock implementation for demo (easy to switch to live API)
- Support for both Nigeria (NGN) and Kenya (KES)
- Automatic currency conversion (USD to local currency)
- Bank and mobile money provider lists
- Detailed error handling and logging

### 2. **Payment Service Integration** (`src/services/paymentService.js`)
Extended payment service with Flutterwave methods:

- `withdrawToNigerianBank()` - Process NG bank withdrawals
- `withdrawToKenyanBank()` - Process KE bank withdrawals
- `withdrawToMobileMoneyFlutterwave()` - Process MM transfers
- `getFlutterwaveTransferStatus()` - Check transfer status
- `getNigerianBanksFlutterwave()` - Get NG banks list
- `getKenyanBanksFlutterwave()` - Get KE banks list
- `getMobileMoneyProvidersFlutterwave()` - Get MM providers
- `verifyAccountFlutterwave()` - Verify recipient account

### 3. **Payment Controller** (`src/controllers/paymentController.js`)
REST API endpoints handling HTTP requests:

- `withdrawToNigerianBank()` - POST endpoint
- `withdrawToKenyanBank()` - POST endpoint
- `withdrawToMobileMoneyFlutterwave()` - POST endpoint
- `getNigerianBanks()` - GET endpoint
- `getKenyanBanks()` - GET endpoint
- `getMobileMoneyProvidersFlutterwave()` - GET endpoint
- `verifyAccountFlutterwave()` - POST endpoint
- `getFlutterwaveTransferStatus()` - GET endpoint
- `handleFlutterwaveWebhook()` - POST endpoint

### 4. **Payment Routes** (`src/routes/payment.js`)
API route definitions:

```
POST   /flutterwave/withdraw/ng-bank
POST   /flutterwave/withdraw/ke-bank
POST   /flutterwave/withdraw/mobile-money
GET    /flutterwave/banks/ng
GET    /flutterwave/banks/ke
GET    /flutterwave/mobile-money/providers
POST   /flutterwave/verify/account
GET    /flutterwave/transfer/:transferId/status
POST   /flutterwave/webhook
```

### 5. **USSD Service Integration** (`src/services/ussdService.js`)
USSD flow for phone users:

- Country selection (Nigeria or Kenya)
- Bank transfer flow with bank selection
- Mobile money flow with provider selection
- Account/phone number input validation
- PIN confirmation before withdrawal
- Real-time feedback for success/failure

**USSD Flow:**
```
Main Menu → Withdraw Money → Flutterwave 
  → Select Country (NG/KE) 
  → Select Method (Bank/Mobile)
  → [Bank: Select Bank → Enter Account] or [Mobile: Select Provider → Enter Phone]
  → Enter PIN → Confirmation
```

## Demo Mode vs Production

### Demo Mode (Current)
- ✓ Mock Flutterwave API calls
- ✓ Simulated transfers
- ✓ No real money movement
- ✓ Perfect for testing UI/UX
- ✓ Banks and providers mocked

### Production Mode (Requires Setup)
1. Set environment variables:
   ```
   FLUTTERWAVE_API_URL=https://api.flutterwave.com/v3
   FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY=your_key
   FLUTTERWAVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_key
   FLUTTERWAVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_key
   ```

2. Uncomment production API calls in `flutterwaveService.js`

3. Replace mock implementations with actual Flutterwave SDK calls

4. Test with small transactions
