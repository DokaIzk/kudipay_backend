# Quick Setup Guide: Connect to Your Deployed Contract

## ✅ Your Contract is Deployed and Ready!

**Contract Address:** `0x6ccDf26970eD11585D089F9112318D9d13745722`  
**Network:** Sepolia Testnet  
**Status:** ✅ **PERFECT FOR MVP**

## 🚀 2-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Get Free Alchemy API Key (30 seconds)

1. Go to https://www.alchemy.com/
2. Click "Sign Up" (it's free)
3. Create account with Google/GitHub
4. Click "Create App"
   - Name: `KudiPay MVP`
   - Chain: `Ethereum`
   - Network: `Sepolia`
5. Copy your API Key (looks like: `abc123xyz...`)

**Free Tier:** 300M compute units/month = **~100,000 contract calls/month FREE**

### Step 2: Update Your .env (30 seconds)

Add these lines to `/backend/.env`:

```env
# Sepolia Network Configuration
NETWORK_NAME=sepolia
CHAIN_ID=11155111
RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
PHONE_WALLET_MAPPING_ADDRESS=0x6ccDf26970eD11585D089F9112318D9d13745722

# Optional: For writing to contract (admin functions)
# DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your Alchemy API key.

### Step 3: Test Contract Connection (30 seconds)

```bash
cd backend
node scripts/test_contract_integration.js
```

You should see:

```
✅ Test 1: Check contract pause status
   Contract paused: false
   ✓ Passed

✅ Test 2: Get contract owner
   Contract owner: 0x...
   ✓ Passed

🎉 ALL CONTRACT INTEGRATION TESTS PASSED!
```

### Step 4: Verify on Etherscan (30 seconds)

Visit: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x6ccDf26970eD11585D089F9112318D9d13745722

You should see:

- ✅ Contract deployed
- ✅ All functions visible
- ✅ Transaction history

## 🎯 What Your Contract Does

### **Core Functions (Ready to Use)**

1. **mapPhoneToWallet(phoneNumber, walletAddress)**

   - Registers a new user
   - Links phone number to blockchain wallet
   - Example: `+2348054969639` → `0xda526aF...`

2. **getWalletForPhone(phoneNumber)**

   - Look up wallet by phone number
   - Returns wallet address or zero address if not found
   - FREE to call (read-only)

3. **getPhoneForWallet(walletAddress)**

   - Look up phone by wallet address
   - Returns phone number or empty string if not found
   - FREE to call (read-only)

4. **isPhoneNumberRegistered(phoneNumber)**

   - Check if phone already registered
   - Returns true/false
   - Prevents duplicate registrations

5. **isValidNigerianPhoneNumber(phoneNumber)**
   - Validates Nigerian phone format
   - Built-in contract validation
   - Ensures data integrity

## 🔄 Integration with Your Backend

### Current Flow (No Blockchain):

```
User Dials USSD → Backend validates → Database stores → Response
```

### New Flow (With Your Contract):

```
User Dials USSD
    ↓
Backend validates phone
    ↓
Check if registered: contract.isPhoneNumberRegistered()
    ↓
If new: contract.mapPhoneToWallet(phone, wallet)
    ↓
Store tx hash in database
    ↓
Response to user
```

### Code Example (Add to walletService.js):

```javascript
const phoneWalletMappingService = require('./phoneWalletMappingService');

async createWallet(phoneNumber, pin) {
  // 1. Normalize phone
  const normalizedPhone = normalizePhoneNumber(phoneNumber);

  // 2. Generate wallet
  const wallet = generateWalletFromPhone(normalizedPhone);

  // 3. Register on blockchain
  try {
    const result = await phoneWalletMappingService.mapPhoneToWallet(
      normalizedPhone,
      wallet.address
    );

    console.log('Registered on-chain:', result.transactionHash);

  } catch (error) {
    if (error.message.includes('already registered')) {
      throw new Error('Phone number already registered');
    }
    throw error;
  }

  // 4. Store in database (with tx hash)
  const user = await User.create({
    phoneNumber: normalizedPhone,
    walletAddress: wallet.address,
    pin: await bcrypt.hash(pin, 10),
    blockchainTxHash: result.transactionHash  // New field!
  });

  return user;
}
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is Sepolia good for production?**  
A: No, but perfect for MVP. Later deploy same contract to Base mainnet.

**Q: Will I need to change code later?**  
A: No! Same contract works on mainnet. Just change RPC URL.

**Q: How much does it cost to register users?**  
A: On Sepolia: FREE. On Base mainnet: ~$0.18/user. On Ethereum mainnet: ~$10.50/user.

**Q: Can investors verify the blockchain integration?**  
A: Yes! They can see all registrations on Etherscan. Fully transparent.

**Q: Do I need to deploy my own contract?**  
A: No! You already have one deployed and working. Just connect to it.
